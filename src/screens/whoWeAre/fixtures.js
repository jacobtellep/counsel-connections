      'Coming out of COVID and on December 14, 2021, our founder, Julian Pecora, had a vision to connect the I-64 corridor. Born from this vision was counsel connections. Since then, we have connected the Huntington/Charleston legal community with speakers ranging from Supreme Court justices to the state bar president. Counsel Connections is an attorney group in West Virginia dedicated to connecting and educating the legal community in West Virginia. We meet bi-monthly in Huntington or Charleston for a networking event that features a guest speaker. We have worked with organizations such as the Young Lawyers Section, Generation Huntington, Up Next Charlie West, State Bar, and many others.  We emphasize connecting law students at the WVU College of Law and the Marshall Pre-law club to lawyers in the State. We are the largest monthly attorney networking group in the State. We have a base in Huntington and Charleston and are looking to expand our reach across the State. Our mission is to retain and promote young professional talent in West Virginia.',

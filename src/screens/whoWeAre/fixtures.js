      'Coming out of COVID, Julian Pecora had a vision to reunite and connect legal professionals along the I-64 corridor. Born from this vision was Counsel Connections. Since then, we have connected the Huntington/Charleston legal community with networking events featuring speakers ranging from circuit and intermediate court judges, Supreme Court justices, state bar presidents, and the dean of WVU Law. Working with organizations such as the Young Lawyers Section, Generation Huntington, Up Next Charlie West, the West Virginia State Bar, and many others, counsel connections is dedicated to retaining young professionals for the greater benefit of West Virginia. To accomplish this goal, we emphasize connecting law students at the WVU College of Law and the Marshall Pre-law club to lawyers in the State. The largest monthly attorney networking group in the State, Counsel Connections has membership in Huntington and Charleston with an eye towards expanding our reach throughout the State.',
